# ObjectDetection-ImageClassification-FasterRCNN
Training a deep learning model (Faster R-CNN) to perform image classification on a dataset characterized by a domain shift between training and test data. The network is trained to distinguish different types of objects by inserting a set of training images. Once the network has been trained, it will be possible to use a set of test images so that the network is able to recognize, with a certain degree of accuracy, which object the test image represents.

For a detailed explanation of how the project works, see the documentation:
